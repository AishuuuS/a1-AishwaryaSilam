## Technical Achievements
1. **`<section>`**: background color, borders, padding, and border-radius
2. **`<h1>, <h2>`**: text color, text alignment
3. **`<ul>`**: padding, line height
4. **`<image>`**: margin, width, height, border radius
5. **`<table>`**: border, table layout, alternating row colors, padding
6. **Javascript Animation**: a box that moves from left to right, and bounces back to the opposite direction continuously, within another box
7. **Semantic HTML Tags**
    - **table**: `<table>` I styled a table to look pretty with alternating color rows and a border. I ran into some problems with trying to figure out how I can alternate the colors, but I managed to figure it out.
    - **image**: `<img>` I really struggled with this initially. I was trying to add a headshot from my laptop to the website, but for some reason it couldn't access the image from my laptop. I made sure the image was located in the same folder and the path was right, but it wasn't displaying for some reason, so I ended up using the image link from my Linkedin picture and used that image url.
    - **link**: `<a>` I created a link to my Github using a background color, padding, and rounded corners. I had to create a class for the link to be able to actaully add the background. Visually, it was difficult to see the hyperlink on the darker section background I had, so I went back to add a background color.
    - **header**: `<header>` I had no issues with displaying the heading of my webpage, but I did play around with the sizing of the header.
    - **footer**: `<footer>` I had no issues with the footer of the webpage but wanted to add a footer to remind myself of the implementation of it.

## Design Achievements
1. **Libertinus Sans font from Google Fonts**: I used this font as my main font for the whole page.
2. **Background Colors**: I used a cohesive color palette from the Adobe color picker (provided in the assignment). After playing around with the tool for a while I found it really easy to navigate and confirm a pink color palette.
